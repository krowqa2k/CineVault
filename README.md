üçø CineVault

It's my first Big SwiftUI independent project which taught me the basics of SwiftUI. I focused on proccesing the API calls and format the data properly into movies/series/actors. 

üçø CineVault is a comprehensive movie and TV show database application designed to provide users with an immersive cinematic experience. Built with SwiftUI and following the MVVM architecture, CineVault offers a range of features and functionalities to explore and manage your favorite movies and TV shows.
